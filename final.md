### Ideas
I would like to build a motorized rotary holder for various keyboards and controllors normally stored on my home desk.  Space is limited and I have multiple keyboards and controllers that would be better stored in a form of veritcal, but still easy to access storage.

This video <!--[here](diebold.mp4)--> below demonstrates a concept on which this ideas is based, although mine would be scaled down to fit on a desk.  It would need to hold, at a minimum, two keybaords, a fightstick, a xbox controller, and preferably a section for office supplies and short term storage. Because it would occupy the spot in which my alarm clock is currently sitting, it would be useful to inlcude a dedicated spot for that as well that doesn't move, which would make it reasonable to have a built in power cord.
